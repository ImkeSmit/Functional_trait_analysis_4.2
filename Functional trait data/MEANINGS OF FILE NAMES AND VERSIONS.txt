###Meanings of file names of the functional trait data
#script: match trait and fac data v2

##DRYIND
As downloaded form email with Nico Gross. Traits of every individual measured

##DRYPOP
As downloaded from email with Nico Gross. Average trait values for species in each plot

##drypop_20May
DRYPOP exported as a csv file

##FT_match_facilitation_plots
drypop_20May subsetted to inlcude only the plots that are also in the facilitation dataset. Variables such as graz, aridity site ID and plot ID were added

##FT_match_facilitation_plots_general_species
FT_match_facilitation_plots subsetted to include only the species present in the facilitation data. The species in this dataset do not necesarily occur IN THAT SPECIFIC PLOT in the facilitation data. They are just present somewhere in teh facilitation data.

##FT_match_facilitation_plots_plotspecific_species
FT_match_facilitation_plots subsetted to include only the species that are present in each plot of the facilitation data. If a species is in a certain plot here, it will be in that same plot in the facilitation data.

##FT_match_facilitation_plots_plotspecific_species_20jan
The same as above, but now the species that are only in the trait data (not in the facilitation data), have been added with NA trait values.

#sp_matches
#exported from match trait and fac data v2
#List of species names and whether they are present in both the facilitation and FT data, only in the fac data or only in the FT data
#in excel I added numbers to names in FT_only and fac_only that are the same but with different spellings. 
	These spellings will be made the same in the cleaning data script.

#sp_matches_1Aug
#exported from match trait and fac data v2 after the names marked in sp_matches were changed. 

#facilitation_species_and_positions
Contains the species names that are in the facilitation dataset, the plot they occur in and whether they are a nurse, occur in nurse microsites (micro_nurse) or a bare microsite (micro_bare). One species may have multiple conditions.
